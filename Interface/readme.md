Q -> Why we need interface ?
A -> Interface are design blue prints, so when designing software they are made
Every method inside an interface is an abstract type.
Every variable inside interface is final static that means it cannot change  

Q -> What happen if an interface is implemented on a class but its methods are not 
overriden 
A ->  that class will become abstract class

-------------
As every variable inside an interface is final abstract -> we can directly use them with 
interface name similar to class we did
